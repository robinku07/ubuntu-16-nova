#
# The Description field is structured following this scheme: (Severity) <Title>
#
# Coverage:
#   NOTE: At this time, hubblestack provides 000% coverage of stig inspections
#     due to the suite of available modules.  As more modules become available,
#     coverage will increase.
#
#   Current coverage:   XX / 264 = 000%
#     High Severity:    09 Done, 06 Partial, 2 Blocker =  15 / 17 = 88%
#       - V-38666: (Partial)
#           - Tailored: Checking for Clam AV packages installed and in cron.daily
#           - Cannot verify the output of the nails status command for
#             McAfee scans a this time
#           - Cannot verify the age of AV definitions as a result of the output
#             of a command at this time
#       - V-38476: Cannot verify the output of the rpm command at this time
#       - V-38491: Cannot verify presence of a file within an discovered list of directories
#       - V-38602: (Partial) checking for running service, but cannot verify the
#           output of the chkconfig command
#       - V-38594: (Partial) checking for running service, but cannot verify the
#           output of the chkconfig command
#       - V-38598: (Partial) checking for running service, but cannot verify the
#           output of the chkconfig command
#       - V-38589: (Partial) checking for running service, but cannot verify the
#           output of the chkconfig command
#       - V-38701: Potentially a false positive if the file does not exist.
#     Medium Severity:  XX / 146 = 000%
#     Low Severity:     XX / 101 = 000%
#
# Tailoring:
#   You may need to tailor some of these inspections to your system/site to account
#   for:
#     1. your environmental configuration
#       ex: using McAfee AV Scan vs ClamAV
#     2. compensating controls you may have
#     3. tailoring you've done for your specific system
